The project is divided into five major work packages, each containing specific subtasks. 
The first stage is Data Preparation, which involves loading the CSV datasets for batting, fielding, and pitching and checking for structural consistency and null values. 
The second stage is Feature Engineering, which computes team averages across key metrics such as OPS, rOBA, Rdrs, RA9, WAR, and WHIP. 
The third stage, Modeling, focuses on building a team scoring function by combining these metrics, followed by implementing a Monte Carlo simulation using standardized score differentials and random noise.
The fourth package, Results Analysis, involves running 10,000 iterations of the simulation, comparing results, and calculating the win rate for each team. 
The final work package is Documentation, which includes writing the functional specifications, WBS, backlog, logs, and roadmap in a cohesive report format. 
This structured breakdown ensured efficient allocation of effort and traceability of progress throughout development.
