The backlog is prioritized to emphasize core functionality and future enhancements. 
The top priority is building a robust win probability prediction model based on the combination of batting, fielding, and pitching statistics. 
The second high-priority item is implementing a Monte Carlo simulation engine that provides probabilistic win outcomes. 
Medium-priority tasks include adding features such as home-field advantage and enabling custom team selections for generalized matchups. 
A lower-priority item includes building visual tools to break down how individual players contribute to their teamâ€™s score. 
All backlog items align with the user needs and allow for incremental upgrades to the simulation system.
